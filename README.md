# Coursera-R-Programming
This repository will take you to the nitty-gritty's from this course. I'll cover some cardinal concepts which we may have a propensity to forget when applying them comes on our head. 

I have also solved programming assignments and have discussed some quiz questions to recapitulate important concepts drawn from the course. Hope this helps!
